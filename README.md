my dots in a nix flake

## TODO

first I need to make sure I have my terminal workflow mostly set up:

- nvim (via kickstart-nvim)
- tmux
- zsh
- terminal tools (fzf, ripgrep, etc.)
 
then I should make it pretty:

- river
- foot
- waybar
- wallpaper

now I should have a usable setup, so start refactoring:

- nix modules
- mako
- wlsunset
- clipboard
- screenshots
- other missing packages (especially graphical ones)
